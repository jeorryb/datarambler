As if I didn't already have enough on my plate I've decided to challenge myself to write 30 python scripts/modules in 30 days. This is a riff on the [100 days of code](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/join-the-100daysofcode-556ddb4579e4) challenge which this might turn into if I'm feeling frosty. I decided to shoot for a reasonable goal of 30 days to give myself a fighting chance. I'm following the [#vDM30in30](http://discoposse.com/vdm30in30/) rules which exclude weekends so I don't become a stranger to my wife and kids. I'm using the challenges on the [pybit.es](https://pybit.es/pages/challenges.html) site to start but I'll probably start throwing in some other scripts/modules that I've been kicking around in my head. I also plan on using this challenge to help out some friends with interesting problems or projects they might have. If you have any suggestions feel free to hit me up on twitter @jeorryb where I'll be tweeting my progress. The plan is to push my code to [Github](https://github.com/jeorryb/30daysofcode) before midnight EST every weekday for the next 5 weeks. Hopefully I can carve out some time on weekends to bank some posts so I can still push on days where I might be falling behind. The main goal is to cultivate a daily habit and at the same time get that little hit of seratonin that comes from completing a task. See you fellow nerds next year.
