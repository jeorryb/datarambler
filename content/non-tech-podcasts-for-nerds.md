Summary: The top 3 podcasts I recommend to any first timers.

I first started listening to podcasts 3 years ago and ever since then I
don't think my car has ever heard AM/FM. If you haven't jumped on the
podcast bandwagon or maybe you're looking for some new casts' to throw
in the rotation give these a try. I've included some of my favorite
non-tech podcasts and some favorite episodes that I think my fellow
nerds might enjoy below.

**99% Invisible**

**99% Invisible is about all the thought that goes into the things we
don’t think about**

This is one of my all time favorites. If you're fascinated by
exquisitely crafted stories about some of the unique buildings,
products, toys, and art of our time then this show is for you. After
listening to this show I found myself looking at objects in my everyday
life in a new light. I also now follow the show's mantra, **"Always read
the plaque!"**

Song Exploder

> **Where musicians take apart their songs**

If you've ever stolen music at any point in your life (everyone) then
this podcast will make you feel really guilty. This podcast takes one
song each episode and deconstructs the songwriting process from the
artist's point of view. I'm amazed at just how much goes into creating
music. The podcast does a really good job of picking a variety of
artists and musical genres for each episode.

-   [Ghostface Killah](http://songexploder.net/ghostface-killah)
-   [Ramin Djawadi](http://songexploder.net/ramin-djawadi) (Game of
    Thrones music)

 

Radiolab
--------

> **Where sound illuminates ideas**

Hands down, this podcast does one of the best jobs of telling stories in
any form of media I've found. They do tend to have a scientific lean to
their stories which should appeal to the inner nerd in all of us.
They've been able to invoke the entire range of human emotions in their
episodes which I love. No two shows are the same.
