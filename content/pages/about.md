My name is Jeorry Balasabas. I wanted a place to organize my current thoughts and projects in hopes of helping others who might be working through similar issues. I’m amazed at how strong and open the developer community has become in the past few years. With as much as I’ve taken in the past, I thought it was about time to contribute. My hope is that you find something useful to take with you on your own ramblings.

I currently work at N4mative as a Principal Consultant. We are an IT services firm with a focus on Datacenter Infrastructure, Big Data, IoT, and Analytics. I get to work with innovative technologies and brilliant people every day. Lately I’ve been focused on Big Data technologies with a focus on automation and data pipelines.
